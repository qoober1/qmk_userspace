# USERS

I've decided to copy userspaces of interest over from the last `qmk_firmware` tag still containing them (which in this case is my `qmk_firmware` fork's `possumdev` branch). I am not maintaining these, only holding onto them for fast reference since I know I'm going to want to revisit them and I *know* I'm going to forget how if I don't grab them now while the knowledge of how to find them is still fresh!

Current userspaces nabbed:
